Learning Python and ObsPy
=========================

MTUQ is written in Python, an interpreted language with a versatile scientific ecosystem.  

One of the most widely used Python packages for seismology is `ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`_.  To allow easy interfacing easily with other codes, mtuq makes extensive use of ObsPy data structures.  

An excellent place to start if you are new to Python is the `ObsPy tutorial <http://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/index.html>`_.

`These other resources <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers>`_ may also be helpful.
