Installation
============

.. rubric:: Dependencies

MTUQ requires a Unix system with standard utilities, including git.  Installation on Windows is not currently possible, but may be in future in future versions.


.. rubric:: Environments

Virtual environments are necessary in Python to avoid dependency conflicts. Because conda does not fully support "editable" installations, virtualenv is currently the preferred environment manager.  This may change in future versions.

   env_conda
