Learning Python and ObsPy
=========================

MTUQ is written in Python, an interpreted language with a strong scientific ecosystem.  

One of the most widely-used Python packages for seismology is `ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`_. 

An excellent place to start learning about Python or ObsPy is the `ObsPy tutorial <http://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/index.html>`_.  These `other links <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers>`_ may also be helpful.


.. note::
   MTUQ makes extensive use of ObsPy data structures to allow easy interfacing with other codes.
