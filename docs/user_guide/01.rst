Learning Python and ObsPy
=========================

MTUQ is written in Python, an interpreted language with a strong scientific ecosystem.  

One of the most widely-used Python packages for seismology is `ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`_.  To avoid reinventing the wheel, MTUQ makes extensive use of ObsPy data structures.

An excellent place to start learning about Python or ObsPy is the `ObsPy tutorial <http://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/index.html>`_.
