Installing mtuq on chinook
--------------------------

Clone mtuq in a directory of your choice:

    > git clone https://github.com/uafseismo/mtuq


Then run the installation script:

    > cd mtuq/setup/chinook
    > bash install.bash


NOTES 

-  `install.bash` loads required chinook modules and creates a pip virtual
environment that can be used during the current session and any subsequent
sessions.  

- `install.bash` creates an editable virtual environment, which means
that any changes to the git repository go into effect immediately. This in turn
means that users can `git pull` at any time without having to re-install.

- By choosing appropriate modules and following the more general instructions
in `mtuq/docs`, users can, at greater effort, obtain the same result as
`install.bash`.



Activating the MTUQ virtual environment
---------------------------------------

At the beginning of each session, users must activate the pip virtual 
environment:

   > source setup/chinook/activate.bash

At the end of a session, it is a good idea to deactivate the environment:

   > deactivate



Running the examples
--------------------

After activating the pip virtual environment, users can run either the serial
example located in `mtuq/examples` or the parallel example located in
`mtuq/setup/chinook/examples`.


The serial examples can be invoked directly:

    > bash SerialGridSearch.DoubleCouple.py


The parallel example must be invoked with wrappers:

    > sbatch submit.bash CapStyleGridSearch.DoubleCouple.py


NOTE

The serial example uses the syngine webservice to obtain AxiSEM Green's
functions.  The parallel example uses a local chinook databaset to obtain
FK Green's functions, similar to the legacy program CAP.



Modifying the examples
----------------------

The above examples reproduce results from Silwal2016. Earthquake waveforms for
the main Silwal2016 test case are included the mtuq repository, so it is not    
necessary to download them. 

To obtain a moment tensor estimate for a different event, users must download 
waveforms using uafseismo/pysep and modify the mtuq example script as follows:

- Update `path_data` to match the pysep download directory.

- Update `path_weights` to match the path to the CAP-style weight file included 
in the pysep download.

- If magnitude is fixed in the example, then update the `moment_magnitude` 
keyword arguments with the estimated moment magnitude.

- Optionally, adjust the Earth model, data processing and misfit settings.
Current choices match Silwal2016.
